# Bestbuy_OrderScraper
Requires the latest version of python along with pip: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Edit credentials in `credentials.txt`. Type in whichever is applicable to you: `GMAIL/PROTON/ICLOUD`.

To run the code with no editor, you can just open the file with Python and it should run. In order to catch errors, you will need an IDE.

The script will create a csv and database file with all the order details, and as a warning, it may miss some tracking numbers that may come with new BestBuy email style changes.
